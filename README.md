# README
- Wanted to streamline the process of playing 10 man's with friends in Valorant.
- Website allows you to queue which then puts you in a lobby.
- Each lobby consists of 10 players of which 2 players are assigned as Captains for Team 1 and Team 2.
- Each team's captain takes turn picking players in a 1-2-2-1-1-1 order (same as FPL and ESEA Rank S)
- The lobby then votes on the series length (BO1, BO2 or BO3) and then a map veto takes place between the two captains in accordance to the ruleset chosen.

# To-Do
- Add coinflip to decide Team 1 or Team 2 and then loser of coinflip gets choice of Team 1 or Team 2 in map veto.
- Add timer per player pick and map veto pick/ban.
- Add stats page where you player profiles can be assigned Riot id's and custom matches can be added.
- Add Public queue / Custom ID queue
